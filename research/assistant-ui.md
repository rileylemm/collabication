# Assistant UI Integration Guide

**Repository:** [assistant-ui/assistant-ui](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui)

## Overview

Assistant UI is an open-source TypeScript/React library for AI chat interfaces, providing primitive components that can be fully customized rather than a monolithic chat component. It's designed with an API inspired by libraries like shadcn/ui and cmdk.

## Key Components to Extract

### 1. Primitive Component Architecture

**What to Extract:**
- Component composition patterns for AI interactions
- Primitive-based design system approach
- Extensibility patterns for custom components

**Implementation:**
- Design our UI following the composable primitives approach
- Create a library of interaction primitives specific to our document collaboration needs
- Implement a plugin architecture for extending component functionality

### 2. Streaming and Real-time Updates

**What to Extract:**
- Streaming implementation for AI responses
- Auto-scrolling techniques for dynamic content
- Real-time update handling patterns

**Implementation:**
- Implement streaming for document modification suggestions
- Create auto-scrolling behavior for document sections being modified
- Design real-time collaborative editing with presence indicators

### 3. Markdown and Code Handling

**What to Extract:**
- Markdown rendering approach
- Code highlighting implementation
- Content formatting techniques

**Implementation:**
- Implement advanced Markdown editing with preview
- Create specialized code handling for various languages
- Design document formatting tools with agent assistance

### 4. Tool Call System

**What to Extract:**
- Frontend tool call patterns
- Human tool call approval flows
- Tool result rendering techniques

**Implementation:**
- Design document-specific tool calls (e.g., cite sources, format section)
- Implement approval workflows for significant document changes
- Create visualization for tool execution results

### 5. Generative UI Components

**What to Extract:**
- LLM-to-UI mapping techniques
- JSON rendering patterns
- Dynamic component generation approach

**Implementation:**
- Create document structure visualization based on LLM analysis
- Design dynamic forms for metadata collection
- Implement visualization components for document relationships

### 6. Accessibility Features

**What to Extract:**
- Keyboard shortcut implementation
- Screen reader compatibility patterns
- Focus management techniques

**Implementation:**
- Implement document-specific keyboard shortcuts
- Ensure screen reader compatibility for all interactions
- Design proper focus management for complex editing operations

## Integration Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Foundation):**
   - Implement basic composable UI primitives
   - Create streaming implementation for agent suggestions
   - Design fundamental Markdown editing components

2. **Phase 2 (Interaction Enhancements):**
   - Implement tool call system with approval workflows
   - Create advanced Markdown and code editing capabilities
   - Design keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

3. **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):**
   - Implement generative UI components for document visualization
   - Create sophisticated real-time collaboration features
   - Design specialized components for agent-human collaboration

## Compatibility Notes

Assistant UI's architectural approach aligns perfectly with our goals:

- The primitive component model works well with our event-driven architecture
- The tool call system can be adapted to work with our npcsh backend
- The streaming implementation can be connected to our event adapter layer

By extracting these components and patterns, we'll create a highly flexible and customizable UI system that maintains excellent performance and accessibility while supporting our unique collaborative document editing needs.
