# NPCSH Integration Guide

**Repository:** [cagostino/npcsh](https://github.com/cagostino/npcsh)

## Overview

NPCSH is an AI toolkit for AI developers that provides a smart command-line interpreter leveraging LLMs to understand natural language commands and questions. It enables executing tasks, answering queries, and retrieving information from local files and the web.

## Key Components to Extract

### 1. LLM Connector System

**What to Extract:**
- Multi-provider LLM connection architecture
- Authentication and API management patterns
- Model configuration and selection approach

**Implementation:**
- Use the LLM connector system as our core backend for agent intelligence
- Implement configuration for multiple LLM providers with fallback chains
- Leverage the provider-agnostic design for flexible model selection

### 2. Tool System Architecture

**What to Extract:**
- Tool registration and discovery mechanisms
- Tool execution pipeline
- Tool result formatting patterns

**Implementation:**
- Adapt the tool system for document-specific operations
- Create custom tools for knowledge graph operations
- Implement specialized tools for document analysis and modification

### 3. NPC Directory

**What to Extract:**
- Agent configuration management
- Agent personality and directive settings
- Agent capabilities and permissions model

**Implementation:**
- Use the NPC directory as the foundation for our agent management system
- Extend agent configurations with document-specific roles and capabilities
- Implement agent handoff and collaboration mechanisms

### 4. Macro System

**What to Extract:**
- Command pattern implementation for LLM operations
- Parameterization approach for commands
- Chaining and composition patterns

**Implementation:**
- Adapt macros for document-specific operations
- Create custom macros for common document tasks
- Implement macro composition for complex document workflows

### 5. API Design

**What to Extract:**
- API endpoint structure and naming conventions
- Request/response formatting patterns
- Error handling approach

**Implementation:**
- Use the API design as the foundation for our adapter layer
- Implement polling and event conversion based on API endpoints
- Create authentication and session management for API access

### 6. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**What to Extract:**
- Document retrieval mechanisms
- Context building approaches
- Query processing techniques

**Implementation:**
- Adapt RAG for our document knowledge base
- Implement semantic search across project documents
- Create context-aware document generation capabilities

## Integration Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Core Integration):**
   - Implement basic npcsh server setup with our configuration
   - Create adapter layer for API communication
   - Design initial agent configurations for document operations

2. **Phase 2 (Tool Extensions):**
   - Implement document-specific tools and macros
   - Create knowledge graph integration with the tool system
   - Design enhanced RAG capabilities for project context

3. **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):**
   - Implement multi-agent coordination through the npcsh backend
   - Create sophisticated document processing workflows
   - Design specialized agents for different document collaboration roles

## Compatibility Notes

NPCSH serves as the core foundation of our system:

- We'll treat NPCSH as an external service without modifying its core
- Our event-driven architecture will be built around the NPCSH API
- Our adapter layer will translate between NPCSH commands and our document operations

By leveraging NPCSH as our agent backend, we gain a robust, extensible foundation for AI interactions while adding our own document-centric collaboration layer on top.
