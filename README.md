# Collabication

An agent-native collaboration platform that seamlessly integrates humans and AI agents for knowledge work.

## Project Status

This project is currently in early MVP development. We are following a "vertical slice" approach to implementation, focusing on creating a minimal end-to-end flow before expanding features.

### Current Implementation:

- âœ… Basic project structure and configuration
- âœ… React application setup with routing
- âœ… Theme context with light/dark mode support
- âœ… Layout component with header, sidebar, and content areas
- âœ… Basic page components (Home, Editor, NotFound)
- âœ… Initial Tiptap editor integration

### Upcoming Development:

- ðŸ”„ Complete Tiptap editor with toolbar functionality
- ðŸ”„ File management system
- ðŸ”„ Backend API adapter for npcsh
- ðŸ”„ Real-time collaboration with Yjs
- ðŸ”„ GitHub integration with isomorphic-git

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start both the React development server and Electron app.

## Architecture

Collabication uses a modern stack:

- React for the frontend UI
- Tiptap for rich text editing
- CodeMirror for code editing
- Electron for desktop application
- Express for backend services
- Socket.io and Yjs for real-time collaboration
