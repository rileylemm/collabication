## Vertical Slice Approach
To make progress quickly, focus on implementing a vertical slice that includes:

1. Basic document editing with Tiptap

4. Basic UI with theme support
5. Single-user functionality before adding collaboration

This will give you a working prototype that you can then enhance with additional features.
