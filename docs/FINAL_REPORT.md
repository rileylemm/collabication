- Diff visualization for changes
- Branch management (create, switch, delete)
- File status indicators in the file browser
- Commit history visualization

The GitHub integration is one of the standout features of Collabication, allowing users to work with their repositories directly within the application. This integration streamlines the development workflow by eliminating the need to switch between different tools.

### Real-time Collaboration

✅ **Mostly Implemented**

- WebSocket server with Yjs backend
- Document synchronization between clients
- User presence indicators (cursors, avatars)
- Collaboration permissions model
- Offline editing with synchronization on reconnect
- User identification and awareness
- Collaboration status indicators

While the majority of real-time collaboration features have been implemented, conflict resolution remains a partially implemented feature. The current implementation provides solid collaboration capabilities with synchronized editing and presence awareness.

### Agent Integration

✅ **Partially Implemented**

- Chat interface for agent interactions
- Streaming response rendering
- Markdown support in agent responses
- Tool call visualization
- Context selection mechanism

The agent UI has been fully implemented, providing the interface for AI assistance. Some advanced agent capabilities like document drafting assistance, code generation, and research assistance are planned for post-MVP development.

### Deployment and Packaging

✅ **Fully Implemented**

- Docker Compose configuration for production
- Automated build process for application distribution
- Environment-specific configuration
- Health checks and monitoring
- Backup and restore mechanisms
- Logging aggregation with Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana

The deployment infrastructure is robust, with containerized services, monitoring, and backup solutions in place. This provides a solid foundation for reliable production deployment.

### Documentation

✅ **Fully Implemented**

- Installation guide
- Update documentation
- User guide
- API documentation
- Testing plan

Comprehensive documentation has been created for all aspects of the application, ensuring that users, developers, and operators have the information they need to work with Collabication effectively.
