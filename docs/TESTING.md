## Testing Philosophy

The testing strategy for Collabication follows these principles:

1. **Test Early, Test Often**: Tests are written alongside code, not after the fact.
2. **Automate Everything**: Manual testing is minimized in favor of automated tests.
3. **Test at Multiple Levels**: Different types of tests capture different issues.
4. **Fast Feedback**: Most tests run quickly to provide immediate feedback to developers.
5. **Trust but Verify**: Components are tested in isolation, but also as part of the larger system.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, ensuring they work as expected when given various inputs. 

#### Components to Unit Test

1. **React Components**
   - Test rendering
   - Test prop validation
   - Test state changes
   - Test user interactions

2. **Redux/Context State**
   - Test reducers
   - Test selectors
   - Test action creators

3. **Utility Functions**
   - Test edge cases
   - Test error handling
   - Test performance for critical functions

#### Unit Testing Frameworks

- Jest as the test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Jest snapshots for UI testing

#### Example Unit Test

```jsx
// Button.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from './Button';

describe('Button Component', () => {
  test('renders with correct text', () => {
    render(<Button>Click Me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveTextContent('Click Me');
  });

  test('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>);
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });

  test('is disabled when disabled prop is true', () => {
    render(<Button disabled>Click Me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeDisabled();
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly, focusing on the interfaces between components.

#### Integration Test Areas

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Test component hierarchies
   - Test routing
   - Test state management across components

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Test API endpoints with database
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test middleware interactions

3. **Cross-Service Integration**
   - Test frontend with backend services
   - Test WebSocket connections
   - Test file system interactions

#### Integration Testing Frameworks

- Jest for test execution
- Supertest for API testing
- Mock Service Worker for network mocking

#### Example Integration Test

```javascript
// githubService.integration.test.ts
import { GitHubService } from '../services/githubService';
import { AuthService } from '../services/authService';

describe('GitHubService Integration', () => {
  let githubService;
  let authService;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    authService = new AuthService();
    await authService.login('test-user', 'test-password');
    githubService = new GitHubService(authService);
  });

  test('lists repositories for authenticated user', async () => {
    const repos = await githubService.listRepositories();
    expect(repos).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
    expect(repos.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(repos[0]).toHaveProperty('name');
    expect(repos[0]).toHaveProperty('fullName');
  });

  test('clones repository successfully', async () => {
    const result = await githubService.cloneRepository('test-repo', '/tmp/test-repo');
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.path).toBe('/tmp/test-repo');
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests verify that the entire application works as expected from a user's perspective, testing complete workflows.

#### Key Workflows to Test

1. **Authentication**
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Sign out
   - Session persistence

2. **Document Editing**
   - Create new document
   - Edit document with Markdown/rich text
   - Save document
   - Switch between editing modes

3. **GitHub Integration**
   - Clone repository
   - Commit changes
   - Pull updates
   - Resolve conflicts

4. **Collaboration**
   - Join collaboration session
   - See real-time updates
   - Edit collaboratively
   - Handle offline/reconnection scenarios

#### End-to-End Testing Frameworks

- Playwright for browser automation
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD execution
- Custom test reporters for detailed logs

#### Example End-to-End Test

```javascript
// documentEditing.spec.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test.describe('Document Editing', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
    // Login before each test
    await page.click('text=Login with GitHub');
    await page.fill('[name=login]', process.env.GITHUB_TEST_USERNAME);
    await page.fill('[name=password]', process.env.GITHUB_TEST_PASSWORD);
    await page.click('text=Sign in');
    await page.waitForSelector('text=My Projects');
  });

  test('creates and edits a new document', async ({ page }) => {
    // Create new document
    await page.click('text=New Document');
    await page.fill('[aria-label="Document title"]', 'Test Document');
    await page.click('text=Create');

    // Edit in Markdown mode
    await page.click('text=Markdown');
    await page.fill('.editor', '# Hello World\n\nThis is a test document.');
    
    // Switch to rich text mode
    await page.click('text=Rich Text');
    
    // Verify heading is rendered correctly
    await expect(page.locator('h1')).toHaveText('Hello World');
    
    // Save document
    await page.click('text=Save');
    
    // Verify success message
    await expect(page.locator('.toast')).toHaveText('Document saved successfully');
  });
});
```

## Performance Testing

Performance testing ensures the application meets performance requirements under various conditions.

### Performance Test Areas
